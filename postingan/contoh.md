hi how are ya? just adding a bit of [multiline text](https://google.com?q=multiline%20text "Google homepage") with a title for the link. And a [link](https://google.com) without to see how it works out in the parser ya know.

  
> een quite for your pleasure just one question, is it multiline? Yes it sure is sir
  
  
Okay so that seems to all work fine, how about some other stuff like *italic* text and using an alternative _italic_ text syntax to make it look more classic and give it a bit of an italian look.
  
And some **bold** text to make it stronger and stuff.

Or **_bold and italic_** just like that
  
And what about bold with a __alternative syntax__.
  
Oh and hey when we're at it why not add some ~~striked through~~ text as well right?
