Okay so that seems to all work fine, how about some other stuff like *italic* text and using an alternative _italic_ text syntax to make it look more classic and give it a bit of an italian look.
  
And some **bold** text to make it stronger and stuff.

Or **_bold and italic_** just like that
  
And what about bold with a __alternative syntax__.
  
Oh and hey when we're at it why not add some ~~striked through~~ text as well right?
